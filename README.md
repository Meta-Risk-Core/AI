# 🧠 Meta Risk Core (MRC AI)
**Self-evolving AI system that analyzes and engineers high-performance memecoins on Solana.**  
Trained on thousands of launches via Pump.fun. Designed to decode risk, behavior, and meme virality.

---

## 🚀 What is MRC AI?

MRC AI is not just a token analyzer.  
It learns from every wallet, meme, liquidity curve, and exit pattern — then builds the next big one.

- Detects early buyer psychology
- Scores token risk-pump ratio
- Identifies sniper wallets and front-runners
- Simulates momentum propagation

⚠️ This is the AI behind $MRC. And it's open for research.

## 📊 Sample Visualization

```python
# This is from notebooks/example_analysis.ipynb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

tokens = ["MemeA", "MemeB", "MemeC", "MemeD"]
scores = [0.74, 0.53, 0.89, 0.64]
risks = [0.15, 0.32, 0.08, 0.22]

plt.bar(tokens, scores, color='green', label='AI Score')
plt.plot(tokens, risks, color='red', marker='o', label='Rug Risk')
plt.title("Token AI Scores vs Rug Risk")
plt.legend()
plt.savefig("docs/ai_vs_risk.png")
```
